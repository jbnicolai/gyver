        "<p>Mind Mapping is an extremely effective method of taking notes. Mind Maps show not only facts, but also the overall structure of a subject and the relative importance of individual parts of it. They help you to associate ideas and make connections that you might not otherwise make.<br \/> By using Mind Maps, you can quickly identify and understand the structure of a subject, and the way that pieces of information fit together, as well as recording the raw facts contained in normal notes. More than this, Mind Maps encourage creative problem solving, and they hold information in a format that your mind finds easy to remember and quick to review, compared with conventional notes. A good Mind Map shows the 'shape' of the subject, the relative importance of individual points, and the way in which facts relate to one another.<\/p>"

An additional advantage of this method is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. Electronic brainstorming also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session.<\/p>"

Close your eyes and notice any tensions in your body and just let each of them go\u2026.That\u2019s right.<br \/> Now, imagine yourself sitting in a field, the grass soft and sweet-smelling beneath you, the sun comfortably warm above and a soft breeze gently rustling the leaves of the trees around the field. You smile within and stand up. As you look around the field, you spot an old gate on one side. You walk over to it, open it and go through into the deserted lane beyond.<br \/> Beneath the archway of branches from the trees either side, you walk slowly down the lane, listening to the soft sounds of the breeze in the trees and distant birds calling to one another. Seeing a stile at the side of the road which leads to a path up a hill, you walk up to it, grasp the stile firmly and climb over. Just as you are about to walk on up the path, you notice a piece of paper on the ground. It seems to have something written on it. With a sense of anticipation, you pick it up and look carefully at it.<br \/> Walking on up the path, you gaze around at the placid woodland scenery as you stride easily between the trees. As the hill starts to level out, the trees end and you see that the upper part of the hill is grassy. Continuing upwards, you see that there is a stone tower at the top, with a single wooden door at the bottom and deep windows at various points on the walls. You reach the door, turn the handle and enter into a single, musty-smelling, dimly-lit room, from which a stairway goes up the tower.<br \/> You walk up the musty-smelling stairway until you come to a closed door at the top. You knock on the door and a vaguely familiar voice bids you enter. You turn the handle and walk into the tower room, which is bare apart from a table and couple of chairs, from one of which a person is rising. The person smiles, walk over to you and greet you warmly.<br \/> Knowing you can trust this person, you talk about important things. They listen carefully, then pause for a while, considering, before giving you a valuable reply. You continue in deep discussion for a while, and then both go to the window to look out across the trees and the fields, pondering what has been said.<br \/> Eventually, you feel that is time to go, and say so. The person agrees and leads you over to the door. Just before you leave, they hand you something. Surprised, you thank them, and then depart, going back down the stairs and out into the sunlight. You then retrace your steps, back to the trees, down the hill, over the stile, along the lane and through the gate, back into the field.<br \/> There, you sit down on the flattened grass where you were before and, holding the gift that the person in the tower gave you, you look carefully at it, turning it about in your hand\u2026..You then muse for a while, remembering your conversation in the tower\u2026..Then you recall the paper you found by the stile, take it out and look at it again.<br \/> After a while, you stretch, open your eyes and come back into the room, bringing with you the insights and discoveries you found on your journey.\u201d<\/p> <\/div>"

The economy is doing well, and the amount of vacant office space is reducing sharply. As part of their decision they decide to use the 6 Thinking Hats technique during a planning meeting.<\/p> <p>Looking at the problem with the White Hat, they analyze the data they have. They examine the trend in vacant office space, which shows a sharp reduction. They anticipate that by the time the office block would be completed, that there will be a severe shortage of office space. Current government projections show steady economic growth for at least the construction period.<\/p> <p>With Red Hat thinking, some of the directors think the proposed building looks quite ugly. While it would be highly cost-effective, they worry that people would not like to work in it.<\/p> <p>When they think with the Black Hat, they worry that government projections may be wrong. The economy may be about to enter a 'cyclical downturn', in which case the office building may be empty for a long time. If the building is not attractive, then companies will choose to work in another better-looking building at the same rent.<\/p> <p>With the Yellow Hat, however, if the economy holds up and their projections are correct, the company stands to make a great deal of money. If they are lucky, maybe they could sell the building before the next downturn, or rent to tenants on long-term leases that will last through any recession.<\/p> <p>With Green Hat thinking they consider whether they should change the design to make the building more pleasant. Perhaps they could build prestige offices that people would want to rent in any economic climate. Alternatively, maybe they should invest the money in the short term to buy up property at a low cost when a recession comes.<\/p> <p>The Blue Hat has been used by the meeting's Chair to move between the different thinking styles. He or she may have needed to keep other members of the team from switching styles, or from criticizing other peoples' points.<\/p> <\/div>"

        "<div class=\"ideaexample\"> <h3 class=\"field-label\">Example<\/h3> <p>The example is a case described by Jacob Buur and Astrid Soendergaard (University of Southern Denmark and University of Aarhus)<\/p> <p>&quot;The design team was engaged in the development of a new pump for domestic heating systems.<br \/> Midway through the development process the User Centred Design Group was asked to assist in involving users to evaluate and improve the usability of the new design concept.<br \/> We chose a participatory user workshop format with six heating system installers and six developers. The users were asked to install, wire and adjust the prototypes in a working heating system and to suggest improvements to the design.<br \/> Both the use activities and the discussions were video taped.<br \/> The Video Card Game took place as a full-day event one week after the workshop.<br \/> In preparation, the User Centred Design group worked through eight hours of video recordings and selected 60-70 short sequences, which seemed significant. The sequences were digitised on the video-editing computer and a key-frame from each was used to create cards for playing the game.<br \/> Participating were four engineers and two usability staff, players from now on. All participated in the user workshop. The game took about six hours in total.<\/p> <p>Step 1: Dealing the cards (30 min)<br \/> Cards were divided randomly in three stacks with duplicates of each. We explained the rules of the game and ran a short training exercise in video analysis (what is observation, what is interpretation?) The duplicate cards would allow for different interpretations of any video sequence later on.<\/p> <p>Step 2: Reading your cards (1 hour)<br \/> The players then split into three pairs to watch their video sequences. The players used the cards to take notes of what they observed. By annotating each card in their own handwriting the developers came to &quot;own&quot; the card. At this stage we encouraged the players to work individually and not to discuss what they saw with their colleague.<\/p> <p>Step 3: Arranging your hand (30 min)<br \/> Together again we asked the players to group their cards openly in front of them on the table. Each player around the table then briefly described their structure. There are no restrictions on how players group their cards as long as it makes sense in terms of the design activity (e.g. user tasks, design problems). During their presentation, developers will recognise which clips are relevant to their design activity. Nuances in the problems at hand will become<br \/> apparent.<\/p> <p>Step 4: Collecting card families (1 hour)<br \/> Each player was then asked to choose a favourite family of cards. One after another the players described as precisely as they could the theme they had chosen and invited the other players to contribute with cards, which seemed to fit into the same theme. Each trick was glued onto a separate poster with a heading denoting the theme. The video sequences were also rearranged on the computer to allow for easy access for the next step. By selecting their favourite themes, the developers take responsibility for relating the design to the user input. Often duplicate cards will figure in the same family, but sometimes<br \/> a video sequence will give meaning to more than one theme, so the duplicate may appear in a different family too.<\/p> <p>Step 5: Discussing the card families (3-4 hours)<br \/> Following a brief discussion of priorities (where should we start?) the players spent time discussing one family after another, trying to understand what the video clips said and what this family would mean to the design. Since none of the players had seen all clips, they each showed their clips to one another and explained why they thought them relevant. <\/p> <p>We find that developers come to use the video again and again throughout such a discussion. We make sure that prototypes and relevant hardware are readily available on the table to point at and think with.&quot;<\/p> <\/div>"

At this point we had collected observational data and documented them in a story format. From the set of all stories, five places that were frequently visited and conveniently near each other were selected. Places included an old age service house,subway station, the subway, a mall, and a grocery store at a mall. A whole day was spent on bodystorming in these locations in Helsinki. Before the session, three researchers had examined all the stories related to each selected location to find recurring problems in carrying out activities in those locations. Problems were formulated as design questions.<br \/> For example, we found that users in the elderly group often had difficulties in finding products at the mall. Consequently, we formulated a design question related to remembering what to buy and what was bought.<br \/> We enclosed 1 to 3 stories (about half a page each) taken from our data to accompany each design question to facilitate concrete understanding of the design question. Design questions and related stories were stapled together and put into a carton folder that was delivered to each participant.<br \/> Ten bodystorming participants consisting of researchers and industry representatives were divided into two groups of five people. All of the participants had at least a moderate knowledge of ubiquitous computing technologies. Within both groups, one researcher acted as a moderator and one researcher as a group leader. The moderator wrote down all ideas emerged in the discussions, and the group leader introduced participants to the design problem, decided when to conclude and to continue to next problem, and when to move to next location. On each location, one design question at a time was introduced to participants. The task was to propose a ubiquitous computing device that solved the problem. Each participant thought about the particular problem at-hand alone for 10 minutes and wrote down ideas to paper.<br \/> These design ideas were then introduced to the group and discussed on-site, when possible. Based<br \/> on the discussion, the group wrote down ideas as scenarios. [...] In addition to preparation costs, we noticed that bodystorming conducted in this manner was exhausting for the participants and required several breaks during the day. Finally, we conducted a preliminary quantitative evaluation of the generated design ideas by calculating the proportion of ideas later accepted by our industrial partners for further development. This bodystorming session was moderately productive in this regard in comparison to other cases.&quot;<\/p> <\/div>"
