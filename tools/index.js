  "description": "Mind Mapping is an extremely effective method of taking notes. Mind Maps show not only facts, but also the overall structure of a subject and the relative importance of individual parts of it. They help you to associate ideas and make connections that you might not otherwise make. By using Mind Maps, you can quickly identify and understand the structure of a subject, and the way that pieces of information fit together, as well as recording the raw facts contained in normal notes. More than this, Mind Maps encourage creative problem solving, and they hold information in a format that your mind finds easy to remember and quick to review, compared with conventional notes. A good Mind Map shows the 'shape' of the subject, the relative importance of individual points, and the way in which facts relate to one another.",

The vote can be as simple as a show of hands in favor of a given idea. This process is called distillation. After distillation, the top ranked ideas may be sent back to the group or to subgroups for further brainstorming. For example, one group may work on the color required in a product. Another group may work on the size, and so forth. Each group will come back to the whole group for ranking the listed ideas. Sometimes ideas that were previously dropped, may be brought forward again once the group has re-evaluated the ideas.",

The introduction of criticisms, judgments and evaluations will stop the flow of creative ideas by making individuals defensive and self-protective, and thus afraid to introduce truly new and different ideas for fear of ridicule. So for a more open minded brainstorm, use Water pistols to shoot down all negative comments in the group!",

The facilitator then compiles a list of ideas and sends it back to the group for further feedback. Electronic brainstorming eliminates many of the problems of standard brainstorming, such as production blocking and evaluation apprehension. An additional advantage of this method is that all ideas can be archived electronically in their original form, and then retrieved later for further thought and discussion. Electronic brainstorming also enables much larger groups to brainstorm on a topic than would normally be productive in a traditional brainstorming session.",

Each participant brainstorms individually, then all the ideas are merged onto one large idea map. During this consolidation phase, participants may discover a common understanding of the issues as they share the meanings behind their ideas. During this sharing, new ideas may arise by the association, and they are added to the map as well. Once all the ideas are captured, the group can prioritize and\/or take action.",

Do you see that you have more to say about one or two of the questions? Or, are your answers for each question pretty well balanced in depth and content? Was there one question that you had absolutely no answer for? How might this awareness help you to decide how to frame or organize your project? Or, how might it reveal what you must work on further, doing library research or interviews or further note-taking? For example, if your answers reveal that you know a lot more about \"where\" and \"why\" something happened than you know about \"what\" and \"when,\" how could you use this lack of balance to direct your research or to shape your project? How might you organize your project so that it emphasizes the known versus the unknown aspects of evidence in the field of study? What else might you do with your results?",

Based on the pre-research of a targetgroup a toolkit is created to get access to useful inspiration and unexpected user information. The toolkit can consist of different tools depending on which inspiration is sought. The key is to make the participants tell about their everydaylife in a project relevant perspective.

It makes the designer aware of what the product should be able to do and hereby how the different funtions and means can be improved or how the problems can be solved. Brainstorming and sketching on different solutions and ideas can be done by sketching combinations of the principled structure of the product (ill. 3) and the quantitative structure of the principles. (ill. 4) By sketching only on the combinations of the parts and elements that compose the product inspiration to new combinations can be created. After having defined the structure of the parts and elements of the product these and the product is designed as a whole.",
